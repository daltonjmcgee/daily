### Resources and details
I was inspired to do this by [Gary Simon](https://github.com/designcourse) of DesignCourse's series on ThreeJS over on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVyRiMvfUNMA1UPlDPzG5Ow). 

The map of San Antonio was generated by capturing a about 15 higher-res images from Google Earth with labels turned off. I then stitched it together in Gimp and exported it as a PNG. The elevation was generated by using the height data from [Tangram](https://github.com/tangrams)'s [heightmapper](https://github.com/tangrams/heightmapper) to capture the location I was using and setting that as my displacement map in ThreeJS. Then an alpha map was generated in Gimp with a big-ass soft brush right in the middle of a 200x200 square. 

[The Texture Map](https://githubphotos.s3.amazonaws.com/texture.png) is too big to post in this markdown file but you can see it there.
